# What is this?

This is essentially a project for me to learn React and Golang, in the beginning it will probably just be React, but when the React part works somewhat I will start adding the Golang part.

# What does the app/webpage do?

It should act as a simple chat application, first with one big single chat, but later on also where you can create a room and invite people to it, and then chat with them.

# Purpose of this???

I want to learn React and Golang, and I think this is a good way to do it, I have never done anything with React before, and I have only done a little bit with Golang (some years ago as well, so i remember almost nothing), so this will be a fun project for me to learn both of them.
